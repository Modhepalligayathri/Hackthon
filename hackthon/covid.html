    <p>Getting the COVID-19 vaccine involves a lot of choices, and misinformation on the internet complicates decision-making. Answer the questions, experience what it's really like to get the vaccine and learn the do's and don'ts for behavior after the shot.</p>

    <p>You may be wondering — do I still have the antibodies? Will they last forever? Am I truly “immune” to the virus, as former president Donald Trump suggested?</p>

    <p>According to the NIH Director’s blog, COVID antibodies could last up to <a href="https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/10/20/two-studies-show-covid-19-antibodies-persist-for-months/" target="_blank">three or four months</a> after infection. No one knows yet how long vaccine-induced immunity may last, but estimates range from <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/length-of-covid-19-vaccine-immunity-5094857" target="_blank">months to years</a>. Some experts believe that booster shots may be necessary in the future.</p>

    <p>Even if you’ve gotten sick already, experts recommend getting the vaccine. But if you were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma while you were sick, the CDC advises you should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html" target="_blank">wait 90 days</a> before getting vaccinated.</p>

    <p>Medical professionals are trying to spread the word that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Though these drugs went through an expedited approval process, that does not mean they’re rushed.</p>

    <p>“The mRNA vaccine, while it’s a newer type of vaccine, has really been under development for five or 10 years,” said Dr. Martin Siglin of AMITA Health at a “Coronavirus Q&A” webinar held by the city of Evanston, Ill. “There’s been a lot of work going on behind the scenes that was used with Ebola and others, so it’s really been in preparation for quite a long time.”</p>

    <p>The vaccines fast-tracked approval because various stages of trials, which are usually done one after another, were done at the same time, said Dr. Kartik Cherabuddi, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Florida.</p>

    <p>Plus, trials are now complemented by millions of people who have received vaccinations outside of an experimental setting.</p>

    <p>“We've seen many, many, many people vaccinated now, even in real world settings, and it's found to be quite safe,” Cherabuddi said. “Severe reactions are very few, in sort of the order of two to three per million vaccinations. That’s very low when we compare it to anything else — a road traffic accident is more likely than a severe reaction to the vaccine.”</p>

    <p>The safety of the vaccines still needs to be tested for children, though.</p>

    <p>The AstraZeneca vaccine uses DNA, which is different from the mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna that are currently approved in the U.S. DNA vaccines put a gene from COVID-19's spike protein into another kind of virus called an adenovirus, modified so that it can't replicate.</p>
    <p>The adenovirus is able to enter your cells, which can read the gene and use mRNA to make copies of the spike protein. The adenovirus sparks your immune system alarm response, and your body begins to build antibodies to destroy cells with the spike protein.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses DNA, and it is only one dose. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both use mRNA.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, it doesn't really matter which vaccine you get, Cherabuddi said. They all do essentially the same thing.</p>

    <p>There are plenty of vaccines that are safe to take while pregnant. The tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough vaccine, for example, is actually <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-covid-vaccines-are-likely-safe-for-pregnant-people1/" target="_blank">recommended</a> for pregnant people to take. But there hasn't yet been much research on the safety or efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine for people who are pregnant.</p>
    <p>mRNA vaccines do not contain a live virus, so they can't give you or your baby COVID-19. Limited data from animal studies show no safety concerns in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html" target="_blank">rats that received the Moderna vaccine</a>.</p>
    <p>Human studies are just beginning: On February 18, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they started a study with 4,000 volunteers to measure the vaccine's effect on pregnant women. Based on the general public's experience, the vaccine <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-covid-vaccines-are-likely-safe-for-pregnant-people1/" target="_blank">appears to be safe for people who are pregnant</a>, but studies should help determine that.</p>
    <p>Some new research suggests that getting the vaccine while pregnant may cause antibodies to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/covid-19-vaccines-for-pregnant-moms-may-protect-newborns-68465" target="_blank">cross the placenta</a> and likely help protect the child.</p>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html" target="_blank">CDC</a>, getting vaccinated while pregnant is a "personal choice" for those who belong to a group eligible to get the vaccine.

    <p><strong>You decide to leave the vaccination site without waiting.</strong></p>
    <p>This could be risky. You leave the vaccination site, and luckily, you don't experience an extreme allergic reaction to the vaccine. You do, however, experience soreness on your arm and a bit of swelling. These are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html" target="_blank">common side effects</a> of the vaccine. You can ease the discomfort with a cold, wet washcloth or by using or exercising your arm.</p>
    <p>Still, leaving the vaccination site before the recommended time could be dangerous if you do experience adverse effects, as you would no longer have a doctor around.</p>

    <p class="title"><strong>You decide to wait the recommended time.</strong></p>
    <p>You wait the allotted 15 minutes, and you feel fine. But later that day,
      when you get home, you start to feel a little off. Since you didn’t experience severe effects in the first hour after vaccination, you should be okay. But you do feel a bit like you have the flu.</p>

    <p>"These are... your immune system reactions," Cherabuddi said. "The most
      common ones are sort of a flu-like illness, fevers, body pains, joint pains,
      chills."</p>

    <p>Though these side effects are "fairly common," Cherabuddi said, they
      go away within 24 to 36 hours.</p>

    <p>To George Washington University medical student CJ Patel, who got the
      first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Jan. 23, side effects wouldn't deter him from getting
      vaccinated.</p>

    <p>"The vaccine's around 95% effective," Patel said. "So I think that having
      one day of very minimal symptoms that are similar to a very light flu or
      cold is totally, totally worth it."</p>

    <p>Patel, for one, did not experience side effects with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. His arm felt sore, as it typically does after getting vaccinated. But in this case, Patel said he felt less sore than he usually does after getting a flu shot.</p>

    <p class="title"><strong>You decide to get the second dose of the vaccine.</strong></p>
    <p>Good for you! It takes about <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/covid-vaccine-19-moderna-vaccination/9558108/" target="_blank">one to two weeks</a> for your immunity to kick in after the second dose. Getting one dose provides only partial protection for vaccines that require the second dose booster.</p>

    <p>Once you wait that amount of time, you are very likely to be protected
      from severe infection from COVID-19.</p>

    <p>Do you have any immunity?</p>

    <p>According to Cherabuddi, you have a bit of immunity. It's just not as
      effective as it could be.</p>

    <p>"It's really good to take two doses, because that's how it's studied," he said.
      "It's better to take the second dose."</p>

    <p class="title2"><strong>Even though you are vaccinated, you still use caution, social distance and wear a mask.</strong></p>

    <p>Even though the COVID-19 vaccine protects you against severe cases of illness, studies haven't yet proven that it prevents you from carrying the virus.</p>
    <p>This means that even after getting the vaccine, you could be an asymptomatic carrier of the COVID-19 virus. You would be protected from its effects, but you could still pass it on to others.</p>
    <p>That's why it's important to keep wearing a mask and distancing for a while after getting the shot.</p>
    <p>"We know the vaccine — and with a very good efficacy, in general — prevents more symptomatic and severe illness," Cherabuddi said. "Does it prevent a very mild or asymptomatic illness? We don't know that."</p>
    <p>However, recent guidance from the CDC gave the green light for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-fully-vaccinated-can-gather-without-masks-b9775dcde0254037e012ea9447e49917" target="_blank">holding indoor maskless gatherings</a> with friends who have also been vaccinated. While distancing and wearing masks in public is still necessary, you could ease restrictions while around other vaccinated people.</p>
    <p>Though the vaccine may not prevent transmission, experts urge that everyone be vaccinated. There are still benefits to protecting yourself against COVID-19.</p>
    <p>"We want to make sure we don't die,” Cherabuddi said. “Getting the vaccine prevents you from getting the more severe symptoms, hospitalization and death."</p>

    <p class="title"><strong>You have a gathering with your friends, masks off.</strong></p>

    <p>If you've been vaccinated — and your friends have been, too — then you <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-fully-vaccinated-can-gather-without-masks-b9775dcde0254037e012ea9447e49917" target="_blank">can have a gathering</a> with them indoors, no masks.</p>

    <p>Still, experts are not sure whether or not you could be an asymptomatic carrier of the COVID-19 virus after vaccination. In that case, you would very likely be protected from illness, but you could still pass it on to others.</p>

    <p>That's why, in public spaces around people who haven't gotten the vaccine, it's important to keep wearing a mask and distancing for a while after getting the shot.</p>

    <p><strong>The COVID-19 vaccines are a light at the end of the tunnel.</strong></p>

    <p>But the timeline to get there is still unclear. Cherabuddi said that 70 to 80 percent of the population must be vaccinated before we hit herd immunity. We don’t know when that will be, but some important milestones are in the works.</p>

    <p>On Feb. 11, the federal government sent about 1 million vaccines to retail pharmacies across the country. And at the end of that month, the FDA approved the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.</p>

    <p>President Joe Biden recently projected that the United States will have enough vaccines for all adults by <a href="Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases" target="_blank">mid-May</a>. Still, it will take longer for everyone to actually receive those vaccines.</p>

    <p>And masks are going to be a staple in pandemic fashion for months to come, even after the vaccines are widely available. It's <a href"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/21/politics/anthony-fauci-mask-wearing-2022-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank">possible</a> that masks may be mainstream through 2022, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>

    <p>There’s still a long way to go toward pandemic control and recovery, but the COVID-19 vaccines are currently the best tool we have to get there.</p>

    <p>“I know there's a lot of uncertainty in the air,” medical student Patel said. “But I think it's so important to ... make sure you're doing your part, getting the vaccine.”</p>
